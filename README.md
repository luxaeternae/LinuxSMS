Build an App overnight

Project goals:
Build a functional Desktop SMS App that can
    - Send SMS to main cell carriers
    - Build a contact list that the user can add too and select from
    - User can view recieved texts (or at least be notified with a link
      to their inbox)


GUIDELINES FOR USE:
Please use responsibly. Only use with gmail email addresses, and make sure they are configured to allow IMAP and POP.

Make sure the email address is your default in your browser, or "show my inbox" will have to be reconfigured to work.
